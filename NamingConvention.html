                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">The Issues</h2>
                    <p>As you may know there have been lots of changes to how we use git with Unreal, main reason being that Unreal uses binary data to save progress un their files. And that means that git can't detect specific changes.</p>
                    <p>Because of that Github Desktop can't properly detect differences in files, and add that other people can change the file at the same time as you, you get conflicts in files rapidly. </p>

                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">The Work around</h2>
                    <p>From My research into how Unreal developers work around this design flaw, it appeared that they used perforce and more specifically the locking system of Perforce. The Locking system speaks for itself, a developer can lock a file for other developers so that they can't push any changes to the server.</p>
                    <p>Meaning that the risk of conflicts goes away as there aren't any differences since you started working in that file.</p> -->
                    
                    <h1 class="PageTitle">Working Together in Unreal</h1>

                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">Tools</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunatly, with Unreal being so restrictive with it's files we have to use tools, Fortunatly i like to make tools and make them accessible for every discipline</p>
                    <p>The 2 tools that we will be using is, Github Desktop and GitLFS Locking App. Both of these application are easy to use and i will explain more in detail how you should use them, and what to do if an error popup reveals itself, In <span onload="HyperClick('Github Desktop')"></span> and <span onload="HyperClick('Git LFS Locking App')"></span>.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">Work Process</h2>
                    <p>Let's follow a standard day and see how you would go about using the tools to maximize efficiency in teamwork. In the morning the first thing you do is <b>Fetch</b> from the current development branch which is: <b>Alpha</b>. After we have had our standup meeting and you have decided what you are gonna do, there 2 ways forward.</p>
                    <p>(1) If you have to add a file there is no need to Lock that file</p>
                    <p>(2) If you have to edit a file you have to Lock that file</p>
                    <p>When you think you are done for the time being <b>Push your Change</b> and if you are done with editing the file for today <b>Unlock the file</b> so that fellow developers can edit that file later down the line.</p>

                    <h1 class="PageTitle">Code Conventions</h1>
                    <p>The Coding conventions are split into 2 categories, Blueprint And C++. While C++ is more for programmers, both designers and programmers should make us of these conventions so that no matter at what stage the project is, we can always understand what is put down.</p>
                
                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">Blueprint Conventions</h2>

                    <p>Before we get to the big stuff, here are some quick blueprint tips.</p>
                    <p class="tip">Remember to Comment sections of your code, if you select multiple functions then press "C" to create a comment block around the selected functions</p>
                    <p class="tip">Check always if a blueprint is locked, and if not check if you yourself have it locked before working on it</p>
                    <p class="tip">To make things more readable straigthen out pin connection, create pin node's. All these have hotkeys to make this less tedious</p>

                    <h2 class="PageSubTitle">C++ Conventions</h2>

                    <p>Here are some quick tips to keep our C++ files consistent between people, or atleast, the headers.</p>
                    <p class="tip">We will keep comments in the header file only, make header files very convenient and cpp files less cluttered</p>
                    <p class="tip">Comment as concise but correctly what a method or variable does/returns</p>
